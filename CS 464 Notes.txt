lecture 1  - OS definition
===============================================================================
What is open source software?

	-> source code is shared to edit and redistrib
		-> even repackage as a new project

	-> collaborative internet-based development

	-> meritocracy, best code/ideas win out
		-> anyone welcome to make contributions

	^^ Not all are necessarily true


Formal def:
	-> goverend by Open Source Inititative (OSI) approved license


1) require - free redistribution

2) require sharing of - source code

3) allow - derived works

4) maintain - integrity of author's source code

5) no discrimination against persons or groups

6) no discrim against fields of endeavor

7) distrib of license

8) license must not be specific to a product

9) license must not restrict other software

10) license must be technology neutral


Key take away:

"free and open source"

FREE AS IN FREEDOM, NOT AS IN BEER



lecture 2 - history of OS
===============================================================================

Technically.. this was the norm at the beginning of computers as software sharing was
	encourage by IBM to get more people to use computers (and hardware sales)

~1970's - software starting to gain traction (showing the value, improve value, etc.. w/o new hardaware)

Diamond V. Diehr (1981)
	-> US supreme court forces patent office to recoginze software algos patents
	-> forced open flood gates on software patents and possible rapid growth of purely
		software companies like Microsoft

Emergence of proprietary software

	-> sw controlled and owned by 1 actor

	-> to protect ownership, code is tightly controlled
		-> only authorized ppl allowed to view and edit

	-> this control and secrecy surroundign how things are done are seen as key to
		controlling the value of SW

		(dependent on vender for updates, etc..)


AT&T looked to close off UNIX, so Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation came along

	-> GNU public license (GNU's Not Unix)
		-> gnu c compiler (gcc)

GNU Public License (GPL)

	-> first free, or Open Software Licenses
		-> many current ones build on this

	4 Freedoms (rights, not cost)
		1) to use
		2) to copy
		3) to modify
		4) to contribute

	-> struggled w/ acceptance for corporate space
		-> enter the Open Source Initiative 
			-> designed to make "free software" more acceptable

Open Source = dev methodology
Free Software = social movement
